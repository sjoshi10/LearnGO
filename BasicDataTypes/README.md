# Basic Data Types

Go's types fall into four categories: basic types, aggregate types, reference types, and interface types. 
* Basic types: number, strings, and booleans
* Aggregate types: arrays and structs
* Reference types: pointers, maps, functions, and channels. They all refere to program variables or state indirectly. 
* Interface Types.
